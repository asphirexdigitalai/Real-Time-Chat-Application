Introduction
This project is a simple yet functional Real-Time Chat Application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase (or any real-time database). It allows users to send and receive messages instantly, creating a live chat experience. The application is responsive and user-friendly, making it a great starting point for learning how real-time communication works on the web.

Features
This real-time chat app includes the following features:

Instant Messaging – Users can send and receive messages in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

Real-Time Updates – Messages appear instantly using WebSockets or Firebase real-time database.

User Identification – Each user can input a name or nickname before joining the chat.

Responsive Design – The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop use.

Timestamped Messages – Each message displays the time it was sent.

Auto Scroll – The chat view automatically scrolls to the latest message.

Technologies Used
This project uses core web technologies along with a real-time backend:

HTML – Structures the chat interface including the message area and input box.

CSS – Styles the chat window with a modern, clean look including message bubbles and layout responsiveness.

JavaScript – Handles the sending and receiving of messages and real-time DOM updates.

Firebase / WebSocket – Manages real-time message delivery and data storage.

How It Works
Sending & Receiving Messages
When a user sends a message, it is pushed to a real-time database (e.g., Firebase). All connected users receive this message instantly on their screens.

User Input
Users type messages into an input field. Upon hitting "Send" or pressing Enter, the message is displayed and broadcast in real time.

Real-Time Updates
The app listens for updates from the backend, and dynamically updates the chat interface whenever a new message is received.
